TODO: now, we can authenticate using JWT token, postman -> getallsession -> Auth[JWT Bearer] -> Secret [token generated
from login] -> 200 ok
- the problem is we dont get any information, so how?

- we didnt update the database yet to accommodate account, so i think the i want to do it like this
- Here are the list of all tables
    exercise - general exercise name and id that all users can access
    session - includes sessionid, date, time (i think i want to put userID here to diferentiate which sessions belongs
                to which user
    activity - includes activityid, rep, sessionid, sets, weight, exerciseid
    users - includes # id, created_at, email, name, role, updated_at, password

Currently, we have added user_id in Session and create a table called Users. When i test the login endpoint in postman,
http://localhost:8080/auth/login, the output is 200 OK :

 now, when i try to test the GetAllExercise endpoint ({{baseURL}}/mana-progress-aku/admin/getAllExercises),
 i put the token in Auth -> JWT Bearer -> secret column. the output is 200 ok but it doesnt produce any data
 of all the exercise that is in the database

 Solution : put the token in Auth -> Bearer Token

 [/] Each user an only access their own sessions (getUserSessions)
 [/] create session
 [/] update session
 [/] delete session
 [/] get session

 ~3 Oct 2025~
 [/] get session activity

~6 Oct 2025~
TODO: for activities, do we want to check the auth also? bc if we do, we need to join Session and activity table to get the user id

[/] get individual activity
    - check if user is auth to see the activity

~8 Oct 2025~
[/] insert activity
[/] update activity
[/] delete activity

~10 Oct 2025~
[/] modify so that invalid token produce error

~19 Oct 2025~
[/] properly adapt to incorporate role
[/] solved getAllActivity issue
