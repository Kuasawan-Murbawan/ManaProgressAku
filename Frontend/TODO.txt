[/] delete session
[/] delete Actvities by session ID - backend
        - currently when we delete session, the activities will be deleted one by one using the activity ID and activities in the activity store
        - but, if we delete session in Past Sessions page, there are actvities in sessionActivities, so can do it, but still not efficient

Q: why do we separate activities and sessionActivities in Activity Store? if it is the same, it is easier to delete
